JIT complier translates the bytecodes into the computer’s machine language. When the JVM encounters these compiled parts
again, the faster machine-language code executes. Thus programs actually go through two compilation
phases—one in which Java code is translated into bytecodes (for portability across JVMs on
different computer platforms) and a second in which, during execution, the bytecodes are
translated into machine language for the computer on which the program executes.
